# Basics of IO

`io.js` is a simple file to demonstrate how to use the `syscalls` module.


# Goal(s)
Use the `read()` syscall to read from `STDIN` and then output it back to `STDOUT`.

# Tip
Read the man pages for the `read` system call in your terminal by running the following command to open the documentation for it.

```
man 2 read
```
