/**
 * Thoughts during development
 * ----------------------------
 * I had to read the docs on `select` a few times to remember what I actually wanted to `select` and when.
 * `select` allows me to pass a list of FD's. It will notfy me when a socket is ready for `read` or `write`.
 * 
 * 1. node nc.js localhost 3000 doesn't work, but it does with the real netcat.
 *    -  Does using Node's built in DNS resovler solve it? SEE SOLUTION, which does make use of `dns` module.
 *        ANSWER: when we pass `localhost` that domain name needs to be resolve to the an actual IP (127.0.0.1 AKA the loopback address)
 *                Also our end server is using 0.0.0.0...that's an actual IP...our module was providing a domain name. 127.X maps to wildcar too.
 * 
 *  node nc.js 0.0.0.0 3000 âœ… worked when connecting to `nonblockingIO-server/server-v2.js`. Probably has to do with DNS resolution see above
 * 
 * 
 * 2.Is blocking really all that bad for a programming like nc, which is only used an operated by one user? Why do we need `select`?
