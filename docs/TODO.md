I was getting a segnmanetatiin error passing an an array with an array .....visualize a simple segfault, define it, understand what it is...ive forgotten.



# Create C library implementing lib
> Goal learn about OS, syscalls (which carry over across language)...not really meant to be used in production?

- learn more about C programming
- porting something across languages
- create a tool for myself to complete the OS course in JS
- create TS definition files...use scientific method
- universities can start using this. Perhaps bradfield....
- Pros: 
-   actually learning the syscalls...
-   easier debugging with VScode & logging.
-   getting familiar with the API. Moving to C should be way easier now.
-   understand how things work under the hood.


Create a repo called:
- C for javascript people: https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/rust-for-js-people

Link it to my other repo.


Try to implement it on your own then view resources. FAIL FORWARD FIRST to build a foundation for comparing, contrasting & improving later.
